# Set this to True to delete the data. 
# If False, take no action and only produce a report of each event to be deleted.

# Current policy, delete any event with no faces. This setting defines a failsafe, requiring a minimum
# face detection ratio across all events be met before continuing with the task. Given the possibility
# that an operational failure may have occured, take no action at all where face detection may not yet 
# have been run for all events.
face_ratio: 0.25  

# Events with high-quality faces are always kept by default. All events with only low-quality 
# images are purged. However, if any face had a high-level of recognition, keep it anyway.
# Events which include a facial recognition confidence above this cutoff, are kept.
