# Default variables for SentinelCam Base Role
#
# NOTE: Most variables come from inventory/group_vars/all/sentinelcam_standards.yaml
# This file only contains variables specific to the base role that are not
# defined elsewhere or need safe fallbacks.
#
# Key variables inherited from standards:
#   - sentinelcam_user: User account (ops or pi)
#   - sentinelcam_group: Group account
#   - sentinelcam_venv_opencv: Virtual environment path (dynamic based on user)
#   - sentinelcam_data_path: Base data directory (dynamic based on user)
#   - sentinelcam_deployment_source: Source directory for code deployment
#
# Code deployment source path (alias for sentinelcam_deployment_source)
code_source_path: "{{ sentinelcam_deployment_source }}"

# For legacy compatibility with other roles that reference sentinelcam_venv_path:
# Note: This references group_vars - if undefined, tasks using it will use sentinelcam_venv_opencv directly
# sentinelcam_venv_path: Defined in tasks when needed, not in defaults
