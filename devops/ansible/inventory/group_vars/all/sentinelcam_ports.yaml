# SentinelCam Port Configuration
# SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all service port assignments
#
# This file defines the standard ZeroMQ port assignments used across 
# all SentinelCam deployments. Individual roles should reference these
# port definitions rather than hardcoding values.

sentinelcam_ports:
  # ImageNode - Outpost camera nodes
  imagenode_publisher: 5567
  imagenode_logging: 5565

  # ImageHub - camera image and data collection from imagenode via REQ/REP socket
  imagehub_zmq: 5555
  
  # CamWatcher - Data capture via subscription to outpost camera image and log publishing
  camwatcher_control: 5566
  
  # DataPump - SentinelCam data retrieval and management   
  datapump_control: 5556
  
  # Sentinel - Vision processing, model inference, and task management
  sentinel_control: 5566
  sentinel_logging: 5565

  # Note: Watchtower does not expose ports, it connects to the following services:
  # sentinel_logging, datapump_control, and imagenode_publisher

# Port Usage Summary (for reference):
# 5555 - ImageHub REQ/REP (data sinks only)
# 5556 - DataPump REQ/REP (data sinks only)
# 5565 - Log publishers PUB/SUB (sentinel, imagenode outposts)
# 5566 - Control interfaces REQ/REP (camwatcher on data sinks and also sentinels)
# 5567 - Image publishers PUB/SUB (imagenode outposts)
