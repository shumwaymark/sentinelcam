# Model Registry Configuration
# Single source of truth for model versions across the SentinelCam system
# 
# This registry maps model names to their current deployed versions (timestamps).
# Models are stored in the registry on the primary datasink and deployed to nodes
# as needed. Versioning happens via configuration changes - models stay deployed
# and only configs/service restarts are needed to switch versions.
#
# Version Format: YYYY-MM-DD (timestamp)
# 
# To rollback a model:
#   1. Edit the current_version to desired version
#   2. Run: ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-models.yaml
#   3. Or use: devops/scripts/rollback_model.sh <model_name> <version>
